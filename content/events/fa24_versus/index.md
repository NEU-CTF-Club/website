GET READY FOR VERSUS CTF with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute’s Security Club!! Join us SATURDAY, SEPT 21, 12PM in Shillman 220 for free catered food, prizes and surprises, plenty of challenges, and fun teamwork. Win up to $25 per person for the first place team! TEAMS OF 3 MAXIMUM! **SIGN UP WITH THE QR CODE IN THE POSTER!** or with link in our bio!

This will be just like our normal CTFs, except that another school will also be participating! What’s in store? What could we possibly do to pit you guys against RPI’s talented (but less talented than NEU) students? Guess you won’t know until you swing by…
