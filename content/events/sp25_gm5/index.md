HACKERS! If you haven't heard about BIG CTF, it's time to crawl out from under your rock on Huntington.
You should ALL be signing up for BIG CTF, our BIGgest CTF of all time ... but if you want to practice before then, let us introduce you to BIG STUDY! 
Join us MONDAY, MARCH 24 at 6PM in Shillman 420 for our GM with NUWiCyS!
We'll be giving you a lot of different types of practice problems, and you'll get a bit of everything!
Pizza will be provided for our studious hackers.
